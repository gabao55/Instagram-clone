<h1 align="center">Instagram clone</h1>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p> Second project developed for Driven Software Engineer bootcamp, you can check it out by this <a href="https://instagram-clone-ten-weld.vercel.app/">link</a>. The first module of the course was an introduction to Interfaces and Front-end Aplications, so we explored the main functionalities of HTML and CSS, so to consolidate knowledge the project task was to create a clone of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">Instagram</a> webpage interface. The webpage might have suferred some updates, so you can check the project's Figma prototypes by clicking this <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/rrweaBwWqOc9pAzk288mKB/Projeto-Instagram?node-id=23%3A2">link</a>
